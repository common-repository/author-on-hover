= WHY DO YOU USE THIS PLUGIN ON YOUR WEBSITE? =

We all know about EAT, right? It implies the Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness of a site. 

And exactly, this is where the author's bio comes into play. It is the best way to introduce the actual author or writer and let the site visitor know about the content creator or the person behind the content creation. Which in turn ensures the article-level and site-level transparency, improves the authenticity and credibility of the site among the users. 

Apart from that, an author’s bio is great to boost your website’s user experience. The main reason behind this is, without the author bio, your entire blog looks incomplete. In addition, when you add social links to your author’s bio, it helps the users to establish a connection with the author.

Another big factor is that, this plugin adds schema markup automatically, without requiring any coding. And, this in turn, helps the Author bio ranking in search result with rich snippets. All in all, having the author's bio on your blog pages makes your site more user-friendly and keeps the readers more engaged with the content.

So, if you want to ensure all these and organize your content using an author bio on hover, this Author Bio On Hover plugin will be the perfect option for you.
